Hello, PS2 users:

I write this program to allow you to play your PAL games 
in color and with the screen centered on hdtv !.

Some PAL games have already built in screen centering. 

The patching engine is based on my PS2 NTSC TO PAL VIDEO MODE CHANGER WITH Y-FIX which 
has a very high successful patching rate.

Support ISO and BIN CD/DVD PS2 images and single ELF files as well.

Attention:
	Case 1) This program will modify the ELF file.
		BACKUP THE ELF FILE FIRST, PLEASE.
	Case 2) For CD/DVD PS2 images the ELF file is backuped automatically.


USAGE:
	Click on 'Browse' and then choose an ELF file or a CD/DVD PS2 image.
	Select the amount of offset to shift the screen up.
	Click on 'Patch File' and read the text output.

First it will try to patch the screen Y position. It will indicate you if
can not find any patch locations or if can not patch the locations found.

Please report any bugs or suggestions to zets55rag@verizon.net


Enjoy your games,
Earl

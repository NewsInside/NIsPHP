So you want to edit your DMC3 savegame? No problem!

What do you need?
A) A PS2
B) Devil May Cry 3 (PAL version tested only)
C) A DMC3 Savefile, transferred from your PS2
   Memorycard to PC. (There are thousands of ways
   to do that. Google is your friend.)

All together? Good!
Start DMC3SE.v1.0-LYRAMSA.exe and now drag and drop
the Savegame file onto the program's banner or
filebox. Read the text at the Status Bar.

Nothing more to say.

Have Fun! ;)

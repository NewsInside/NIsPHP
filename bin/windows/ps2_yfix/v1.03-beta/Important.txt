This info relates to the amount of Y-FIX OFFSET to use.

VERY IMPORTANT: you will never see the complete picture on your TV when patching from PAL to NTSC. This is because PAL has more height resolution (more lines) than NTSC. If the PAL game is not fullscreen (has 2 small black bars at top and bottom) then it may be possible to watch the whole picture in NTSC. Usually you will lose some part of the bottom picture. With the correct Y-FIX offset you can minimize this problem. I think also that with the proper amount of Y-FIX OFFSET you can split the lost lines between the top and the bottom of screen.


If you choose an OFFSET to high the game may not work or be unplayable.

** For starting i recommend you to use 32. **

When you get more experience (like watching for the screen position on 
your TV and guessing how much could you increase the OFFSET to shift the screen UP) you can try to increase the Y-FIX OFFSET.

For your information my PS2 Y-FIX 
uses the default of 48 to shift the screen DOWN.

** Then you may try to use 48 or 40. **

Values greater than 48 will probably make the game not work or unplayable.

Also i do not know if there is a relation between the amount of Y-FIX offset and the progressive/interlaced screen mode. For your reference, an even number of y-fix patched positions may mean interlaced mode and 
an odd number of y-fix patched positions may mean progressive mode.

Maybee someone could maintain a list with the game name, patching results, Y-FIX OFFSET used and some info (like 'a bit more OFFSET will center the screen better', 'i still see a black bar at top','screen centering perfect', ...) for helping other users.

| CDVDGEN ISO Builder by JRLS | -- June 2004 version 1.2 ------------------------------------
=============================================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure the VB Runtime DLL's for VB6 are installed on your computer. 
You might have to install some other components (.OCX files) too if this program asks 
for it.

HISTORY: Earlier version has a small bug in it. When files or folders were used with spaces 
in it, the program would just say the ISO was build, but in fact, it wasn't!
This release should fix that.


Info:
-----
This tool is tested on Windows 2000 and Window XP, but in theory it should work on any 
Windows 9X system and any other Windows system above Windows 95, including ME, NT, etc..
NOTE : It will NOT work on Window 3.11.

Purpose:
--------
This Tool will build an ISO using the parts that were generated by $ony CD/DVD Generator.
It will use the COPY /B function, so nothing fancy.
Just making it easier!

For instance, if you have the following files 
   multi.001
   multi.002
   multi.003
that must be pasted to a new file "final.iso", then it will be done using
COPY /B multi.001 + multi.002 + multi.003 final.iso
                      

Quick help for this tool:
-------------------------
[Files]        : When clicking this, you can select the files that should be pasted
                 together. You can select more than one file at a time by using
                 CTRL and/or the SHIFT buttons like you normally would in Windows
                 Explorer (multiselect). When one or more files are chosen, they will 
                 be sorted automatically on extension (*.000, *.001, *.002, etc...)
[Clear]        : All files in the list will be deleted.
[Delete]       : All selected files in the list will be deleted. You can also access 
                 this button by pressing DEL. Multiselect is available by using CTRL 
                 and/or the SHIFT buttons while selecting files.              
[Sort]         : All chosen files in the list will be sorted on extension.
[Destination]  : Choose the destination file.
[Arrow up]     : Move the selected files up in the list.
[Arrow down]   : Move the selected files down in the list.
[Build]        : When you're finished with your input files and they are in the right
                 order, click this button to paste all the files together. They will be
                 pasted in the order of the list. When pasting big files together this 
                 might take a while, so be patient.

  <br />
  <span class="style5">USBUtil
      is a program created to try images of games of PS2, in the format
      ISO9660 standard (8+3) (name+extension), which will be able to be used
      by USBExtreme/USBAdvance/USBLoader. This time has been wanted more than
      a convertor, to do a tool that facilitates a range of options in the
      field of the images of games for disc five-peseta coins. Later an

    <br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: orange;; font-size: 14px;"><strong><b>SOME IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT WILL BE TREATED&nbsp; IN THIS VERSION </b></strong></span></span>
<h4 class="style26"><strong> INFORMATION </strong></h4>
<p>First of all I want to say that USBUtil v2.00 was created principally  not to have to depend on another any software to be able to modify our  games, on the contrary we can protect and take care to the maximum of  the same ones, be which is the modification that applies him, always  and when one does not use the option to fill with rubble, we will be  able to restore and to obtain the original game.<br />
</p>
<p>All the methods used by USBUtil cannot be tried to explain from another software, since the realized operations are in order to use our games from a hard disk (HD), never compatibility tries to be created by CD / DVD, so I do not guarantee the same one, the best results will be obtained from the same software, the method to restore is the best tool to obtain our original games after having being modified, this one is sure 100 % providing that there is not used the option to fill with rubble or re-compiled across another program foreign to USBUtil.</p>
<p>This version will try to improve a bit the compatibility and the work with the games for USBAdvance/USBextreme/USBLoader, allowing a series of options that facilitate the modifications that apply him to certain games in order that they could be executed correctly, trying always not to damage the original game, that is to say all the changes are realized saving always the original information.<br />
  Nevertheless three methods have created for ripear the games and to include the effected modifications, the compatibility and efficiency of the same ones depends on possible internal protections to the game, therefore the guarantee of the same ones will be proving these.<br />
  Later some important topics are mentioned for the treatment and modification of the games, these are:<br />
  &bull;   As uses the package of patches USBUtil's DNAS/IOPRP.<br />
  &bull;   As replace files (to support our LBA).<br />
  &bull;   As injecting files to our games (our files to set to work for those of the game).<br />
  &bull;   As coincide files (files of the game to make coincide, as icons, levels, and others in general).<br />
  &bull;   As a video to visualize or to edit a file of the game (to associate files of the game with external programs).<br />
  &bull;   As guarding our changes done by USBUtil of permanent form and to diminish the size of some games in the HD (To Rip).<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style47">Others:</span><br />
&bull;   As deactivates a file (it to put to zero), since to eliminate files DUMMY, since all kinds of file to change without re-compiling and without any delay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style26">EXPLANATION ON THIS TUTORIAL</span><br />
Due to the quantity of options that they added to the program and not to be too extensive, this TUTORIAL will include only the added ones in this version, staying as well as I complement with the TUTORIAL of the version 1.02</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span class="style42">Principal Menu</span> <span class="style47">New options for order</span></h4>
<p><span class="style45">File</span><br />
In file they have added two new options, To open ISO [To explore / To modify] and To create GAME / ISO from CD / DVD,later I will explain each of them.</p>
<p><span class="style45">Open ISO [To Explore /To Modify]</span><br />
This option allows us to be able to explore / modify standard ISO 9660 with format of (8x3) characters (name x extension), specially images of PlayStation's 2 CD / DVD. On having given click on the same one a panel will appear showing the current directory and the ISO files(s) found in the same one, selecting with the bar one of them, we will be able to accede to the submenu of options for ISO. This submenu will be explained closely in the section of Useful in the principal menu hereinafter. See image #1</p>
<p><a href="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=881&amp;g2_serialNumber=2"><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=881&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="1" width="505" height="393" border="0" /></a></p>
<p class="style5"><strong>Image #1</strong>, Selecting a file with right click one accedes to the submenu of options.</p>
<p><strong class="style41">Note:</strong><br />
  When an ISO image cannot be opened by USBUtil, it is very possible that the same one is not compatible with USBAdvance, USBExtreme, the more recommended is to create the image from USBUtil, which contains a compatible enough method.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style47">To create GAME / ISO from CD/DVD</span><br />
This option like his(her,your) name indicates it allows to create GAME / ISO from our reader of CD / DVD, it is important to clarify that the method included by USBUtil was designed specially to extract games of PS2, so his(her,your) compatibility overcomes some before used for this option, USBinsane, ultraISO and others, proved(tried) under certain circumstances and that they have caused mistakes in the same ones, USBUtil has overcome and managed to create a compatible image. This is not a critique, to the opposite we know and recognize of the reputation of the mentioned softwares, only that for any cases the im&aacute;genes cannot be executed by USBAdvance / USBLoader.</p>
<p>I want to mention besides the fact that an option is included to patch DNAS / IOPRP, on having finished the creation of the GAME / ISO, this can be activated in the panel of patching, as the old option of Way has been included, it is possible to leave this one for fault in Car to avoid the inconveniences(troubles) and if we wish that a GAME should be created / ISO, simply we select to our taste, not without before naming what we want to create. For more detail the figure sees #2</p>
<p><span class="style41">Detail of Importance:</span><br />
When a GAME / ISO wants to be created from CD / DVD we must introduce for first you see a disc before calling USBUtil, later all the rest will be recognized, otherwise it will not be recognized. </p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=884&amp;g2_serialNumber=3" alt="2" width="505" height="374" longdesc="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=884&amp;g2_serialNumber=3" /></p>
<p><span class="style49"><strong>Image #2</strong>, The button To create only  will be active if it is possible to proceed, this will depend on the  size of the unit and the information to guarding and if the present way  is recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="style42">USEFUL (principal menu)</span><br />
In this one they have added several options, beside modifying some, later it appears and they explain for order.</p>
<p><span class="style47">Recover Game </span><br />
  The option to recover the configurador ul.cfg for this version was modified completely, though it supports the compatibility with the old method of ul-old.cfg, being able to recover for this route.<br />
  The level of priority is as it continues:<br />
  &bull;   first: Analysis of ul.cfg<br />
  &bull;   second: Analysis of ul-old.cfg<br />
&bull;   third: In this point one proceeds to the recovery for the file usbutil.rcn, which is created and updated automatically.</p>
<p><span class="style41">Note:</span><br />
  The recommended recovery is the last one of the three, since the file not only works like recuperador, but also as warehouseman, this one registers all the games spent(passed) by the program, even exist or not, for future recoveries, of this one it forms when we do not have idea of what recovers, these will have the last name registered by USBUtil. In this version one does not believe the former file ul-old.cfg, to this one importance is reduced for not having reason of use.<br />
  Later an image shows itself of few changes effected externally to this option. See image #3</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=883&amp;g2_serialNumber=3" alt="3" width="504" height="374" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #3</strong>, The possibility of recovering is indicated, according to the result take the information.</p>
<p><span class="style47">To Edit / To See [ul.cfg]</span><br />
  This new option allows us to edit some fields of the file configurador ul.cfg, the fields #1-name of the game, #3-byte zero are put of alone reading, these will not be able to be modified so the game would be altered of erroneous form, the others can be modified carefully in some case, but of any form the condition of the game is altered and can cause problems. This option only is possible on the games, does not have use for ISO (s). Later we show the image #4.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=893&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="4" width="505" height="374" /></p>
<p><strong>Image#4</strong>, The fields marked in red sound of alone reading, the field #2 contains the region and code, the others can be modified following the showed information. <br />
It will be possible move on the fields of the ul.cfg with the buttons [&lt;&lt;], [&gt;&gt;] or messing about on the number of the field to visualizing.</p>
<p><span class="style47"><strong>Parch DNAS/IOPRP</strong></span><strong><br />
</strong>This topic for the importance of the same one I will emphisize and it will try to include all his utility.<br />
<br />
This  option allows to patch a GAME / ISO, in the moment that is called the  interior of the same one is explored as it is the case, the program  creates a list of all the opposing DNAS/IOPRP, it(he,she) will show if  it is necessary patch or not, this does not want to say that it(he) is  obligatory to put a patch, the same one one will owe to if the game  needs of this, because it(he,she) does not run with  USBAdvance/USBExtreme, the motives in order that the games do not run  they are different and this topic is a bit polemic, there are several  opinions, especially I will indicate some that seem to me to be more  guessed right, These can be for the use in the games of the port USB  and he meets in conflict USBAdvance, USBExtreme that use the same one,  other one could be that the speed of reading is too much slow since the  port of the PS2 is USB 1.1, besides other protections including the  DNAS/IOPRP. For these USBUtil there has his first package DNAS/IOPRP  v1.00 that this contained in 2 files, the usbutil.dni (index of the  DNAS/IOPRP) and usbutil.dna (it contains in if the files used to  inject).<br />
<br />
Continuing with the topic, on having visualized  DNAS/IOPRP's window, only there will be able to be patched those that  it is allowed them, if in some moment a DNAS/IOPRP is detected not  found in the package the impossibility of the patch will be indicated,  for more options, to refer to the topic of Manual Configuration, in  which one gives a series of tools to modify the GAME / ISO. More detail sees image #5.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=889&amp;g2_serialNumber=3" alt="5" width="504" height="374" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #5</strong>, Here one shows the opposing  DNAS/IOPRP, only it is allowed mark those that have not been patched. I  have taken this example, since this game goes out with USBUtil patching  the DNAS280, that for the traditional method changing this one into an  IOPRP and re-compiling the ISO it was not possible, since the same one  contains protection for LBA and on having be modified it stops running.</p>
<p><strong class="style41">Note:</strong><br />
  I want to clarify  that this package will not serve us for all play them, only for a group  of they that need to be patched, in addition I hold this one to changes  and improvements to include a major quantity of them. For more  information continue reading up to the topic Manual Configuration,  which sure him will be of more help. <br />
This option To patch present  this one in the principal menu and can accede to her by means of right  click in the submenu on a GAME / ISO.</p>
<p><span class="style47">To Check structure</span><br />
Other one of the options of USEFUL is her of checking the structure of the GAME / ISO, of this form we can assure if our GAME / ISO this one in good condition, in the same one finds out if there is existence of invalid or crossed references, I will make clear very rapidly of that it consists an invalid, this reference it is not any more than when a file points at a direction missed since it can be over the size of the game, this supposes a mistake record, for what it would not work of assurance, the cross-reference is when a file aims at other one, this I finalize it does not take as a mistake, alone warning, is very natural to see this indication working with USBUtil.</p>
<p>Other information contributed by this option is:</p>
<p>Number of directories and files, existence of the SYSTEM.CNF, region and code of our game, the DNAS/IOPRP found and a valuation of this how the condition of the same one. For more detail see image #6</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=896&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="6" width="324" height="324" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #6</strong>, See the informed details, the red color denotes mistake record in the condition of the GAME / ISO.</p>
<p><span class="style41">Note:</span><br />
This way with this option when our friends us send an ISO we will be able to know if this one this one correct, we must know that alone it is applicable to images of PS2.</p>
<p><span class="style47">To see current configuration</span><br />
Here another informative option in USEFUL, but it is directed more the modifications effected by USBUtil, since they are files coinciding, injected, deactivated and illegal, the above mentioned possess neither name nor extension, but they have assignment in the table of the LBA, for not being declared correctly USBUtil he declares them like illegal, seems to be that they guard secret information or is some type of protection, an example of this happens with Final Fantasy X, if we observe the size of the DVD some Mbytes is alone, see the image  #7.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=899&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="7" width="324" height="242" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #7</strong>, See also the information about the condition, the current size and the original one before being filled with rubble.</p>
<p><span class="style41">Note:</span><br />
It is possible that some ISO is filtered and the values like the former original size it is eliminated and the awaited information does not offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="style42">Rip GAME / ISO </strong><br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style41">Important&nbsp; information: </strong><br />
  This  method is not compatible with CD / DVD, only it can be used for USB-HD,  all the rest as COINCIDE, INJECT, DEACTIVATE, REPLACE and other  modifications on a GAME or ISO are completely compatible, if some case  it was not it is due to certain protections for LBA and of another type  known, that is to say our changes done from USBUtil can be kept in the  wished time including all the mentioned options, later it can restore  his game to the normal condition by means of Restoring (TOTAL) /  (PARTIAL) structure see options of restoration.<br />
  <br />
This option  allows to fill with rubble our GAME / ISO and this way to guard all the  modifications done by USBUtil, also it is possible to try to diminish  the space that they occupy them same in the HD. There exist three  methods of Filling with rubble that they are: Normal (East contains the  major quantity of information about the GAME / ISO seizure of the  original one), Ideal (It Contains the information that supposedly is  necessary, without including terminals), Extreme (It Contains the  necessary information of the game of PS2 to execute in a HD). The  latter is most recommended for the use by USB (USBAdvance, USBExtreme),  IDE (HDLoader, HDExtreme), I must say that some game can stop running,  since there exist some of them that contain protections for LBA or  other strangers, who will not allow that this one should be modified.  Nevertheless we can always try try to liberate some Gbytes in our HD  supporting our complete games.</p>
<p><span class="style47">Another route to reduce more space in our HD</span><br />
It forms other one of diminishing space in our games, is modifying these, Activating / deactivating files like DUMMY, videoes and others, USBUtil brings an option to make to coincide videoes, this will do that all the videoes execute for the minor of them, clearly this one, the games that contain the formats included for this version, another form is using the option Manual Configuration, we can explore the GAME / ISO and see that we can deactivate, I from the beginning of this version of the software, did some tests, there are some games that it is possible to deactivate the videoes since they do not check the same ones (Medal of Honor), other one that contains a file DUMMY that occupies a good space is (Prince of Persia 3), when this one deactivates the game works perfectly well in 1.6 Gbytes approximately.</p>
<p>Alone USBUtil tries to give a tool that facilitates the manipulation, the best result will obtain it to measure exploit the software.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, when one gives click taking the option to fill with rubble, USBUtil will explore the GAME / ISO and will create a virtual structure, showing we would have the result, to take the this option of his part. See image #8.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=902&amp;g2_serialNumber=3" alt="8" width="405" height="242" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #8</strong>, Observe the resultant size on our GAME / ISO having been rip.</p>
<p><br />
  <strong class="style41">Note:</strong> <br />
  This method  was created only to be used for for HD, already it is USBAdvance,  USBExtreme, USBLoader or HDLoader and HDExtreme on the hard disks for  USB or for IDE (SLIM, PS2 Fat). <br />
  <br />
  Later I show some games Rips  with the Extreme Option, must remember that this process is  irreversible and alone it has use for hard disk as USB-IDE, as all the  methods, it cannot be able to be filled with rubble and save any space,  but always it is good to try, of assurance I am that as to my, to many  it comes very well.<br />
  <br />
  In the table later some games appear with  the option To fill with rubble End, to none of these games there has  applied him no modification, but if we make coincide videos with any of  them, a better result will be obtained in the size, since it is the  BurnOut Dominator that can manage to weigh 0,97 GB and the Black up to  1.34 GB, this way also FIFA's 2008 and others, very well to incorporate  games in the memories flash (pendrive / portable).<br />
  <br />
  I personally managed in a pendrive of 4Gb, coinciding videos to introduce the following games:<br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style47">Table of games rips with USBUtil and played from a pendrive of 4 Gb (memory Flash)</strong><br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black...........................1.34&nbsp; GB&nbsp; (rip with the videos coinciding)<br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MVP 2003....................0.95&nbsp; GB&nbsp; (rip with the videos coinciding)<br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BurnOut Dominator........0.92 GB&nbsp; (rip with the videos coinciding)<br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtua Tenis SEGA..........0.33 GB&nbsp; sin rip<br />
  <br />
  To these games one made them coincide the videos couple occupy less space.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style47"><strong>Table of games rips with USBUtil and played in a HD, for USBAdvance/HDLoader</strong></span><br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name of game&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Real size&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GB reduced<br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black........................................3.64 GB..........................1.24 GB<br />
  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call Duty &ldquo;World at war&rdquo;..............2.78 GB..........................1.24 GB<br />

  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the Ring 3.......................4.24 GB..........................0.99 GB<br />
  <br />
  Some  games rip with rip extreme, here the real size and the quantity proves  to be alone in GB reduced after rip extreme, these games have not been  modified, only rip.<br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style41">Note: </strong><br />
  The  methods of rip (Normal and Ideal) were designed to incorporate major  information into the game from the original one, since in some cases  only the modifications included by USBUtil are preferred putting and  the size is not so important, in addition some games can bring secret  information inside the same one.<br />
These games here mentioned were  proved in a SLIM by USBAdvance by USB and in a fat PS2 by HDLoader  v0.8c by IDE and they all ran perfectly well, the result of a game that  does not run after being rip is exactly equal in both cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="style42">Active, Desactivate and Coincide VIDEOS</strong><br />
  <br />
  These  three options of useful as other it is possible to accede to them with  right click on a GAME / ISO and they are for this route inside the  option of FILES: Configuration (Options for videos). These were created  in USBUtil to try to improve in some games the slowness at the moment  of executing the videoes (cinemas), it is of more remembering that the  USB in PS2 is 1.1 and does that some formats are weighed for the same  one.<br />
  <br />
  The recommended option and that more profit will give us is  VIDEOS coincide, since they do not allow great quantity of games that  the videoes should be deactivated (position to zero his size), the  method of coinciding is based in aiming at all the videoes to that of  minor size and with this to do that the delay is small, avoiding  certain inconveniences caused by the transfer by the port USB,  nevertheless the option to deactivate can be proved and if it is  allowed, perfectly it can be secondhand.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Finally we will see To  activate VIDEOES, this one allows us to activate all the videoes of  general form, even if someone has been injected, I am useful here to  say that we can create our own video of interval and inject this one,  later make it coincide and we will obtain the visualization of our  video in every cinema.<br />
  <br />
Later a sight of the menu (option Useful) image #9.</p>

<p><strong>Image #9</strong>, Many of these options can be called by the speed keys, another route is to use right click on a GAME / ISO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="style42">Restore GAME (PARTIAL/TOTAL)</strong><br />
  <br />
  This  option is of great utility, the same one allows us to return our games  to the original condition before modifying it, USBUtil includes two  types of restoration, the first PARTIAL Restoration allows us to  restore all the changes, without altering Patches and injected and  replaced Files, specifically only it acts on the files deactivated  (positions in zero) and internal coincidences in the game, nothing any  more will be restored, unlike the option TOTAL Restoration, which as is  indicated will restore quite the changes including Patches and  Injections. Later we show the images #10 and #11</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=908&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="10" width="297" height="121" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #10</strong>, See information Rest. Partial </p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=911&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="11" width="295" height="119" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #11</strong>, See information Rest TOTAL </p>
<p><strong class="style26">Note: </strong><br />
  These options are  of great utility when we want to undo some change or not wished  modification, the total restoration is the indicated one for these  cases.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style42">MANUAL Configuration</strong><br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style26">Information: </strong> <br />
  All  the modifications effected here will be able to be restored from the  option of restoration, with the exception of replacing that the same  one acts without saving the information, for this case extract a copy  and support the real size of the file.<br />
  <br />
  To this option it will be  possible accede from a GAME or ISO with right click, later there appear  two images, one for every case. See image #12-#13</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=914&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="12" width="505" border="0" height="375" /></p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Image #12</strong>, I access to Manual Configuration across a game, also it can be done by the rapid access (Ctrl. + M).</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=917&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="13" width="505" border="0" height="375" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #13</strong>, I access to Manual Configuration across an ISO, this option is limited from rapid access.</p>
<p>Later the panel of Manual Configuration, see the details of every  information that appears, it is important to know each of them, they  will be made clear more detailed.<br />
  See image #14<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;<img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=920&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="14" width="505" border="0" height="374" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #14</strong>,&nbsp; See every assignment with a number associated to facilitate the explanation of the parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="style42">OPTIONS OF MANUAL CONFIGURATION </strong><br />
  <br />
  <strong>1)</strong> Memory to store files, this one allows to store files later to make  them coincide, can be one o more, the memory possesses an indicator of  whole and selected, when a group of files are sent to memory  automatically they are marked to try. This option facilitates that  there could be stored files of different extensions.<br />
  <br />
<strong>2)</strong> List of existing files, primeramente want to say that USBUtil explores  our images and the files are separated by extension, for fault the  first files that will try to show each other are those of extensions of  Videos, if these are not a message will be expressed indicating to  change VIDEOS into FILES (option 4), this way to be able to explore the  others who are inside the game. Later one explains all the options of  the submenu (accede with right click) that are allowed for the files.</p>
<p><br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style42">OPTIONS OF THE SUBMENU(rigth click)</strong><br />
  <br />
  Later  there appears the submenu, which one accedes for right click on or the  files, the options of the same one will explain immediately afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=923&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="15" width="505" border="0" height="495" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #15</strong>, Here a sight of the submenu of options for the files.</p>
<p>Later the topics will be answered as To Activating, To deactivate, To  coincide, To inject and To replace, let's remember that USBUtil gives a  great facility, since never it is needed to re-compile the GAME / ISO  and the modifications can be done on our games on the external hard  disk.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style47">2.1) &ndash;As To Activate/ To Desactivate one or more files </strong><br />
  To  deactivate simply we can mark with Ctrl. + Click all the files we wish,  then acceding to the submenu with right click we take the option To  deactivate marked, hereby the files will put in not active (equal Size  to zero), otherwise in Activating marked we would have them in Assets,  in case of being an alone file, IF/NOT gives double left click for  turnar the activation. Later only We must Apply changes to save same  realized, See image #16.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=926&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="16" width="324" border="0" height="324" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #16</strong>,  See as the file 02_P.M2V and the others (they are not activated), to  save the changes only it must press the button Apply changes.</p>
<p><span class="style47">2.2)-Select for Directory or All</span><br />
  These options will allow to mark the files, the first one To select for directory it is very useful, with this one we will be able to verify that files belong to the same directory for if we want to make coincide these with those of another directory, to store them to memory or simply to disable the same ones, I want to clarify something of a lot of importance, when USBUtil explores a directory the files they are read on order of creation, this one is the most suitable form to be employed the same ones at forms of groups, since otherwise To show tidy list the files will gather in crowds for alphabetical order, but ultimately we will choose be convenient for us and mas simple be. Only it can only to say that To select all and as his name Indian selects all the files of the showed extension. It finalizes this one very usefully when we want to extract the whole content of the list for some another place.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style47">2.2)-Show list (Tidy/for fault)</span><br />
  If we want to see the elements of the list we will be able to do it tidily or for the order read by USBUtil from the game, as before I said to convenience it will be possible show the files.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style47">2.3)-Coincide (HERE) on</span><br />
This one is one of the options that will allow us to coincide one o more files with the current file under the blue bar, it is necessary to clarify that always one coincides with the last marked file and this will do that they all appear towards this one, it is possible to do of two forms, if none is marked and one orders to coincide, all the files will do it to which is under the bar, if there is a group marked at the time all the marked ones will aim at the current one, to mark it is possible to do of several forms (Ctrl. + left Click, Shift+cursor, or simply dragging the bar with the click left. Pressed), this option only allows to coincide files of the same extension, that is to say, those who are in the same list, later one will show himself of so many examples on that they could put, this one is in the game Black (to see forward) and simply I prove to be like all the languages of a level coincide, to the Spanish language, when one proceeds, USBUtil marks the files with arrows, these can indicate two things depending on the position of the same ones, if the saetas &quot;&gt;&gt; &quot; they are ahead it wants to say that this file is being aimed for one o more files and they are coinciding on him, if the arrows are behind, the file is not active, is coinciding (appearing) towards other one, the information shows itself in the field (9) image #14, this information includes (Directory, Name of the file on the one that one is coinciding and the size of the same one).</p>
<p>Hither to it is easy to understand the functioning of this option, but there exists really a case that it tends to confuse and to be when a file contains arrows ahead and behind, knowing that when a file is coinciding it is not active for yes, but this one can be activated if someone coincides on him, this wants to say that a file can point at another file coinciding, the result is, that the one that coincides on him will show the information of this one, and he in turn, it will show the information of the file about the one that is coinciding, it is good bear this case in mind mentioned to obtain the awaited result, always USBUtil will show a line of help reporting on whom one coincides and this way to facilitate more the work.<br />
  Also another way of coinciding files exists, this one will be treated in Injecting files, let's see the example of the Black in the image #17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=929&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="17" width="324" border="0" height="324" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #17</strong>,  Here there appear the files of English, French, German and Italian  speech coinciding (appearing) on the Spanish-speaking file, see as  those who coincide they are deactivated, in the top part it reports on  whom one coincides.<br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style26">Note: </strong><br />
When  several files post to fill with rubble contain arrows ahead and do not  contain behind, this wants to say that they all sign between them,  since on having filled with rubble I take only one (they they all  contain the same LBA's value and the same size), all they are the same.</p>
<p><span class="style47">2.4)-Coincide memory (HERE) on</span><br />
This option is identical to the previous one, his this difference with which different extensions can coincide using the memory of storage, in addition groups of files can coincide, this happens between the memory and the list of files for extension, in this one it finalizes, there can be several marked, if it is like that the groups coincide between yes for the order of the files, See the image #18.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=932&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="18" width="477" border="0" height="249" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #18</strong>,  Here they will make coincide all the SPCH of the level 0 with all those  of the level 8, this will give as result that when one executes in the  level 0 traverse the SPCH of the level 8. (Applying memory Coinciding  (HERE) on).</p>
<p><strong class="style47">2.5)-ADD to memory </strong><br />
  This  one is the option that will allow us to guard one o more files to  memory and this way to facilitate the operations of coinciding, they  can add to this one all the files be wished and the operations will be  realized by those who are marked.<br />
  <br />
The quantity of elements in  the list, the marked ones and the characteristics of the file under the  bar will be showed. See image #19 for more detalis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=935&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="19" width="325" height="137" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #19</strong>, The yellow line of help  shows us the directory, the name of the file and the size of the  current one under the bar. (Above the whole and the selected quantity  appears).<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style47">2.6)-CLEAN memory</strong><br />
  When one wants to clean the memory it will be able to execute this option.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style47">2.7)-SEARCH for size </strong><br />
  This option allows to look for the file of Minor size or Major size positioning the bar on the same one.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong class="style47">2. -EXTRACT&hellip;</strong><br />
  If  it wants to extract files from the interior of the GAME / ISO, this  option allows us to do it for a selected destination, in case a this  file coinciding it will be able to choose between the real file or on  that they coinciding.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=938&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="20" width="413" border="0" height="135" /><br />
  <strong>Image #20</strong>, Since it is possible to see there is the possibility of extracting the real file or of coinciding.<br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style26">Note:</strong> <br />
If  we select a group and inside this one files exist coinciding we will be  able to choose to extract groups of files (the real ones, or those who  are coinciding).</p>
<p><strong class="style47">2.9)-INYECTED and to coincide &hellip;</strong><br />
  Is  here one of the most useful options of the program, this one is the one  that allows to introduce files inside the GAME / ISO without modifying  the original condition of the same one, the changes producidor  injecting a file is minimal, that is to say the values in the tabal of  the alone LBA receives the modification of an alone file (the one that  is modified), the others do not modify for very big that is the  injected one, this is of great help for the games that some LBA check.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  USBUtil  denotes the file injected with an arrow and the sign number (&gt; #)  after the name of the file, as I explain to him in case of coinciding,  also the file this one deactivated and it follows the same rules.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  First  of all I want to explain as the process passes of injected, I spend #1:  we must look that we are going to inject new file, I spend #2: to  extract this one from another game and it to guard on our disc, Step  #3: to look for the game that we want to modify and to go to the manual  configuration, I spend #4: we look and position the bar on the file to  injecting,<br />
  <br />
  I spend #5: with right click we take the option to  inject, I spend #6: we select the file previously guarded in the disc  and press To inject, and already this, that is to say this method  replaces a file with other one without destroying the real one,  injected simply it will work for the real one, giving the opportunity  to be able to restore it if he wishes later, this is very good to prove  the funcionabilidad of some file inside the game, if it works, well,  but simply we continue trying with others or restore the original one.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
An  example of the use of this method is in the option to patch DNAS/IOPRP,  only that USBUtil does it automatically when one proceeds with the  change of the same ones. To inject will facilitate to us one of the  most useful tools wished by those that like to modify the games, here  we will be able to try with files IRX, DUMMY, videos of PS2 and files  in general, later I show an image and the example that I have taken to  show. See image #21</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=941&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="21" width="344" border="0" height="303" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #21</strong>,  Here mostrar&eacute; a particular case, since I want to change the file of  video on which all the videoes are coinciding, for smaller one, I want  that they know that not always there are small videoes inside the games  and USBUtil always will take one (the smallest of all), but this one  even this way can be weighed in the transfer for the port USB, in a  case of these, we can extract some minor's video weight of another game  and inject it on the file solving this way the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="style26">Later, the steps to continuing to do that everything stays according to the awaited thing:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1-</strong> A video of little seeks and to extract size from another game, to store it in a specific directory, see To extract<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2- </strong>We enter to the game that we want to change the video and with the  manual option to accede to the same one putting the blue bar on the  file that possesses the arrows ahead.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3-</strong> We give right click on  the file and press the option To inject and to coincide, a window will  appear to look in the directories for the file extracted previously see  image #22.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;<img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=944&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="22" width="407" border="0" height="308" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #22</strong>, We select in the directory the video guarded previously and press the button of injecting.</p>
<p><strong>4-</strong> Already the file this one injected and it contains the wished video,  now it is necessary to make coincide all the videoes towards the new  video, see the image #23.<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;<img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=949&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="23" width="344" border="0" height="303" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #23</strong>,  Later something like that would stay To injecting, see that the files  point towards the real ancient video, that is to say at the real file,  now it is necessary to make them coincide on the injected file.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5-</strong> We  must give right click and select To coincide (HERE) on, for this case  we must select to coincide Not the real file, we will select file of  COINCIDING, all the videos will point at the new video, here I show an  image of how it would stay. See image #24.</p>
<p><img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=950&amp;g2_serialNumber=3" alt="24" width="344" border="0" height="301" /><br />
  <strong>Image #24</strong>, Later to the step 5, something will stay one shows since here, now all the videos they appear on the injected one.<br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style26">Note: </strong><br />
Good  if we want to inject an IRX or another file anyone we must follow the  same procedure, separating the IRX that we wish in a directory and take  the option To inject and coincide on the IRX or file to modifying.</p>
<p><strong class="style47">2.10)-REPLACE&hellip;</strong><br />
  Here  we have the perfect method for when LBA's protection exists in the file  to modifying, replacing it is based in overwriting a file on other one,  but as everything it has his disadvantage, this one really if it  modifies to the GAME / ISO, so if we want to restore the file we must  extract a copy of the same one before replacing. As the previous option  this method works on the file under the blue bar, to difference that  can apply a replacement to him on the real file or on the file that  this coinciding or injected, this new secondhand file cannot be of  major size, only minor or equally, now if it is minor and We do not  support the real size, it will never be possible re-put the master  copy, for this USBUtil gives the opportunity to support the original  size, this can cause some imbalance in the game when the length of the  new file this one below the real one, but if it is a file (IRX, DNAS,  others) feasible it(he,she) must not have importance since these end  for if and they will finish in the just place, not interesting the  remaining information though it is loaded on memory.<br />
  <br />
  Let's see  an example of how to replace a file, primeramente extract the file that  will serve us for the replacement and copy it to a directory, later we  look inside the manual option for the file that we want to replace and  pressing right click and we choose TO REPLACE. See the image #25.<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;<img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=953&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="25" width="407" border="0" height="309" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #25</strong>,  If it is activated To support you will be able to replace the file  always and be minor or equal to the original size, but if it wants to  fix it to a minor size do not activate the same one and it was taking  the size of the file used to replace (This be to be sure since hereby  it will never fit the file of master copy), it must know that the  replaced files will not show any change before USBUtil if they are of  the same size.</p>
<p><strong class="style47">2.11)-Properties</strong><br />
  This  option is the one that will offer to us the detailed information of the  file under the blue bar, this information includes name of the file,  size, directory and the values of the LBA taken for the Real one and  the file of coinciding. See image #26<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;<img src="http://scenespain.net/imagenes/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=956&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="26" width="342" border="0" height="301" /></p>
<p><strong>Image #26</strong>,  This one is the only option that shows the value of the LBA, of both  files, besides the name, directory, size and condition of the current  file.</p>
<p><strong class="style26">Note: </strong><br />
  Hither to the options of the submenu, it is continued by the options of the window of Manual Configuration.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3)</strong> Extensions of the VIDEOES and FILES, image #14 (3), in this window show  themselves the existing extensions inside the GAME / ISO and divide in  two, when we enter to Manual Configuration, USBUtil primeramente looks  for all the extensions of videoes recognized for this version and they  are those that primeramente sample as VIDEOES, at the same time there  creates a list of all the files in general, including those of video  also, to this one it finalizes it is possible to accede changing  VIDEOES into FILES, hereby it will be able to see all the files of the  game in general. This window contains a small submenu with right, this  click has two options (To activate, To deactivate), it allows  activar/to deactivate the files of the showed extension, of this form  is mas rapidly (activation / deactivation) of same one.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4)</strong> For VIDEOS and FILES, image #14 (4), Into this window the extension changes for Videos / files.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  <strong>5)</strong> Buttons of associate programs, image #14 (5), These three buttons allow  to associate the files of the GAME / ISO with three external programs,  I denote them with three names (Player, Publishing, Different), but  really the name does not have any meaning with the programs to  associate, can be anyone, I have taken the same ones as my own utility,  for player I use the VirtualDup, as publisher the UtraEdit (since I  allow to edit in hexadecimal), and in other one we could put any other  one as a desemsamblador to be able to reschedule some file of the game,  when these buttons are associated, at the time they will be active,  otherwise they will be deactivated, for more information the option of  the menu sees Configuration that hereinafter will be explained.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>6)</strong> Button to apply the realized changes, image #14 (6), East allows to save all the changes realized in the modified files.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>7) </strong>Size of the files under the bar, image #14 (7), This information shows the size of the files marked under the bar.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>8)</strong>  Directory of the file under the bar, image #14 (8),  Here shows itself the directory to which the file belongs under the  bar, is put here in order that it could compare with the directory of  the file coinciding if it is necessary.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>9)</strong> File coinciding  or injected, image #14 (9), This one is the information that comes from  the files coinciding or injected, it appears in case of coinciding, the  directory, name and size, in case of being an injected file the name  and the size of the above mentioned file.<br />

  <strong class="style26">Note: </strong><br />
Hitherto the options of MANUAL CONFIGURATION, it will be continued by the near option of the principal menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="style42">CONFIGURATION</strong><br />
  <br />
Configuration  contains three options and the same ones refer only to the part of  associating, these are: To associate with &hellip;, Erase config. partners,  Save config. of partners.)<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;The first one of them shows a window  to associate three buttons of Manual Configuration, a program will be  able to associate each one, defining if it wants or not to send any  parameter and if the file that will be extracted will be erased or not  later to the use. See image #27.<br />
  <br />

<p><strong>Image #28</strong>,  Here it will be able to select the program to using, it can form a  parameter and decide if the file later to the use will resign.</p>
<p>The option To erase config. partners, allows to erase all the buttons of the memory and the disc (To clean configuration).<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Finally  To save associate Config., it allows to record to the disc the current  configuration, in order that it could be loaded by USBUtil to the  beginning of the program, supporting this way the same one.<br />

  <strong class="style42">Future of USBUtil, ISEKO Team</strong><br />
  <br />
  I  have tried to create a better utility with this version, and though  really it is very difficult nowadays to programme only beside not  having access to Internet, since my resources are very small, with  sacrifice I have managed to finish this version.<br />
  <br />
  Also I must be  grateful for my friends who for e-mail help me and keep me up to date  (especially to eustolio) since of another form it me had been  impossible, so, it is an important part of this project.<br />
  <br />
  Hereby  I have tried to assemble persons who have the necessary interest to  continue with the project for USB, and ISEKO Team will try not to  centre only on utilities for PS2, but also for other consoles as PS3,  ON XBOX 360 and Wii.<br />
  <br />
  Our modest contribution to the world of the  games will be those help all that the game should form a part of his  entertainment, hereby the group will work on since being able to help  to play for the ports USB in any team.<br />
  <br />
  I possess very few  resources, but all those that want to help will be able to do it across  the software, assurance there will be good results in the measure that  manages to obtain the same ones.<br />
  <br />
  Ado, enjoy this software. <br />

  <strong class="style47">Note of the one that signs: </strong><br />
  <br />
  I  go from the year 2005 experiencing the method of load for USB. Of  surpluses it is known the lacks that the port offers to us 1.1 of  Playstation 2, of there his incompatibilities<br />
  <br />
  In this point the  majority already we know the process to try in the possible thing to be  able to play with our copies of safety across an External HD, though  they have been the own users those who have taken charge of it, to the  detriment of $ony.<br />
  Many are the utilities that the good  non-profit-making sceners have drunk to us. I want to be grateful for  all of them your time and dedication, and especially to you ISEKO that  even with your lacks you have achieved to assemble in an alone soft  everything necessary for the user.<br />

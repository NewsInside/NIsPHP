Rad Host Client version 1.8a
===============

Rad Host Client is a GUI tool to provide the pc side of the ps2 host filesystem
protocol. I have written this to make it easier to use than the ps2client for
people who simply want to use it with ps2 software such as uLaunchELF and SMS.

It uses a virtual filesystem for the root directory. Just drag and drop files
and directories onto the main window. These will then appear in the first level
of the host filesystem.

It automaticcaly connects to the ps2. As you change programs from uLaunchELF to
SMS it will automatically attempt to reconnect.

Automatically add inserted CD/DVD discs and USB drives to the root virtual filesystem.

You can now also edit labels after dropping them in.

Now supports writing, deleting and renaming.

Minimize to tray now implemented with icon showing connected status.

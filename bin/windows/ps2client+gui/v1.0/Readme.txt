What is this?
-------------------------------------------------------
This is a little gui for ps2client

ps2client, sience not many today lived the good old dos
times, and also for the lazy ppl like me ;)

How to use
-------------------------------------------------------
-Copy the Gui to the directory with ps2client
-Start Programm (gui)
-First set the path to your ps2client.exe
-Second set the ip of your ps2 (example 192.168.0.10)
-In the next step you can add directories that you want
 to use with the host option of SMS. If no elflist.txt 
 is avaiable the gui will make one, so make sure its in
 the same dir as ps2client.
-With the arrows you can sort your list.
-Finally press ok and ps2client will start.

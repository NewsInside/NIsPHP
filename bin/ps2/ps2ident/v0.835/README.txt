PlayStation 2 Identification tool (PS2Ident) v0.835	- 2018/12/08
====================================================================

PS2Ident is an identification tool that allows dumps of a PlayStation 2 console's ROM chips and MECHACON NVRAM to be made.
It will also gather data from the console, for research purposes.

It has the following features:

*Dumps the boot ROM chip.
*Dumps the whole DVD ROM (rom1:, rom2: and erom: in one file) chip.
*Displays the actual addresses for DEV1 (rom1, rom2 and erom) that are set by the ROM filesystem drivers.
*Coloured user interface that is easy to use.
*Supports dumping to memory cards and USB mass storage devices.
*Supports multi-languages, which include the 8 supported languages by the PS2
*Gathers data of all known parts of the PS2.
*Attempts to automatically match the chip/part name with the version number of the part.
*Supports all PlayStation 2 consoles, including the SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000 and SCPH-50009, and the PSX (DVR unit).

How to use this software:
---------------------------
Extract the whole archive (do not delete any files or folders) onto a location on a supported device.
The only supported devices are the Memory Card and USB mass storage device.

When the console's mainboard cannot be identified, the mainboard model will be "unknown".
A database record file (*_database.bin) will be generated when a dump is made. No personal information is recorded.
When making a submission (only when your mainboard is not recognized),
please provide the database record file and your console's mainboard model.
If the mainboard model is not provided, your contribution will not be accepted.

If possible, please help to complete the chip ID list as well,
for any part that is not identified ("unknown") or is incorrectly identified.
When doing so, please provide the full model of the part, especially for the MECHACON chip (e.g. CXP103049-401GG).

As for the chassis and EMCS ID (For Dragon-series units):
	At the lower right-hand corner of the product information sticker that is either on the bottom
	or back of the unit, there will be something like "H FOXC".
	In this example, the letter 'H' is the chassis model,
	while "FOXC" stands for FOXConn (the EMCS that made the console).

Notes:
	1. Chip and mainboard identification is currently very incomplete and inaccurate, due to a lack of data.
		Sometimes, Sony makes hardware revisions without changing the chip implementation numbers as well,
		hence why chip identification may be inaccurate.
		The chip and version IDs are, however, accurate since they are taken directly from the hardware.
	2. Slimline consoles that had the SSBUS I/F Controllers integrated into the IOP will report them as version 0x31.
	3. Due to some SSBUS I/F controllers reporting the same version number (0x31), those will be all generalized
		and reported as "CXD9611". All of them are supposed to be fully compatible anyway.

Mainboards are uniquely identified by:
	ROMVER string
	Model name
	EE revision
	FPU revision
	IOP revision
	GS revision
	MECHACON revision and region
	SPU2 revision
	SSBUS I/F Controller revision
	Model ID
	Console model ID
	EMCS ID
	M Renewal Date
	ADD0x010
	BOOT + DVD ROM Checksum

Identified data:
	Emotion Engine (EE)		- "main" processor of the PlayStation 2.
	I/O Processor (IOP)		- "sub" processor of the PlayStation 2. Most peripherals are connected to this.
	Sound Processor Unit 2 (SPU2)	- Sound processor.
	Graphics Synthesizer (GS)	- Graphics processor.
	MECHAnics CONtroller (MECHACON)	- Drive mechanics controller.
	SS-BUS InterFace Controller	- InterFace (I/F) controller for the DEV9 expansion device.
	SPEED chip			- The controller chip on an expansion device (e.g. Network Adaptor).
					  It's not known what "SPEED" stands for.
	Ethernet PHY			- The Ethernet PHYsical transceiver on a network adaptor.
	i.Link controller		- The IEEE1394 controller that is integrated into the IOP chip.
	USB controller			- The OHCI USB controller that is integrated into the IOP chip.
	Boot ROM			- Read-Only Memory (ROM) chip containing the kernels and basic IOP modules.
	DVD ROM				- Read-Only Memory (ROM) chip containing the DVD player.
	NVM/EEPROM			- The Non-Volatile Memory storage that the MECHACON has,
					  for storing settings (system, RTC and CD/DVD drive).
	ROMVER				- The ROM VERsion string that identifies the version and build date of the
					   boot ROM.
	ROMGEN				- The ROM GENeration number that identifies the date that the boot ROM
					   was generated.
	AIF				- On a DTL-T10000(H), the DEV9 interface is connected through the AIF.
					  The AIF also provides a RTC and IDE controller.	
	Machine Type			- Software value that determines the operating mode of the EE kernel,
					  hence machine dependent.
	Model name			- The name given by SCE for the console. The SCPH-10000,
					  SCPH-15000 and DTL-H10000 will always show up as "SCPH-10000".
	Chassis				- The internal build/model/type of the console.
	MPU board			- See MRP.
	MRP (BoardInf)			- The MRP is the interface between the PS2 and PC sides of a DTL-T10000(H).
					  All DTL-T10000(H) units have a MPU 4.0 board as the MRP.
	i.Link ID			- Contains the part of the IEEE1394 EUI-64 address that uniquely identifies
					  the console, the model ID and EMCS ID.
	EMCS ID				- Uniquely identifies the Engineering, Manufacturing and Customer Services (EMCS)
					  system that made the console.
	Model ID			- Uniquely identifies the console's model. Even more accurately than the
					  model name.
	Console ID			- Contains the EMCS ID, (another version of) model ID and serial number.
	M Renewal Date			- What this represents is unclear. It's something related to the
						MECHACON (date of firmware build or EEPROM settings update?)
	ADD0x010			- An ID that is used by the SONY service tools to identify major revisions.
						Originally at word 0x010 of the EEPROM, it was moved to word 0x01 for the Dragon models.
						It does not always correspond with the chassis models (i.e. C and D-chassis have the same ID).
						It can also identify the loadout of the console,
						like its CEX/DEX status and the OP block installed (i.e. SANYO or SONY).
	PS1DRV Version			- The version number of the PlayStation driver. The earliest ROMs do not have PS1VER in ROM.
					  For Japan, only the SCPH-10000 and SCPH-15000 lack this file. "1.01" is hardcoded.
					  For other territories (should be only the earliest SCPH-30001), "1.10" is hardcoded.
	DVD Player Version		- The version number of the built-in DVD player, if applicable.

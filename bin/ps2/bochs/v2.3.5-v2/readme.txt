This is PS2 Bochs 2.3.5-v2 port by KarasQ

The program starts with default parameters (arguments) "-q -f mass0:/BOCHS/bochsrc.txt",
which means you have to copy BOCHS folder to your pendrive.

If you need, you can try to run it with other parameters through RadShell (I didn't test it).

If you have any questions, the best place to ask one would be

or my e-mail k4rasq@gmail.com (It may took a little till I answear).
I don't sent any disk images or ISO images so don't ask me for any.

REMEMBER TO MAKE DATA BACKUP FROM YOUR PENDRIVE BEFORE YOU RUN THIS SOFTWARE. I DON'T GUARANTEE CORECT WORK. I DON'T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSE OR HARDWARE DAMAGE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

To run it copy BOCHS folder to your pendrive root folder. Store your hdd images in mass0:/BOCHS/DISK folder and remember to configure mass0:/BOCHS/bochsrc.txt as you need (just set up HDD image) and run mass0:/BOCHS/BIN/PS2Bochs-2.3.5-v2-packed.elf by your preferred method (Free McBoot, Swap Magic, Modchip, etc).

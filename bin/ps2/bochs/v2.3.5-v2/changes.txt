Changes history:

Bochs 2.3.5-v1:
	- Initial version, basic port

Bochs 2.3.5-v2:
	- compilation with all optimisation options
	- fixed SDL bug: fullscreen option at startup crashes emulation
	- changes in default configuration file to make it more stable (less RAM) and
	  faster (fullscreen option by default)

In v1, changing screen mode on the fly by SCROLL LOCK hangs emulator, but
please notice it's not a bug. It's caused by lack of memory to
reallocate screen. To fix this, you should change amount of memory
in bochsrc.txt to smaller value (less than 20 MB). In v2 memory is defaultly
set to 18 MB because of this issue and because of optimisations options
which take some more memory.

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open PS2 Loader is a 100% Open source game loader compatible with 
USB Advance/Extreme game format. It's more compatible and it should work
without ps2load or change DNASXXX.IMG tricks.

Open PS2 Loader also is developed continuously and anyone can contribute 
improvements to the project.

The main objective is to support both the PS2 and the PS3 with backward 
compatibility.

There are compatibility lists in the project repository:

	http://bitbucket.org/ifcaro/open-ps2-loader/wiki/SMB-Compat

How to use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you need an USB device compatible with PS2/PS3 formatted in FAT32
(only if you want to load games from USB).
For using games directly from USB, game parts file must be perfectly
defragmented, either file by file, either by whole drive.
You can use this great software, Power Defragmenter:

For loading games by SMB protocol you need to share a folder called PS2SMB
(it can be changed) make sure that it has permissions for anyone to access.
The games have to be in USB Advance/Extreme format. There are some programs
for converting games to this format. Open PS2 Loader includes an command line
tool for that purpose called iso2usbld.

Other utilities are: USBUtil 2.0, USB Extreme installer or USB Insane.

In PS2 you can use any of the existing methods for loading an executable elf.

In PS3 you need to have an original SwapMagic 3.6+ or 3.8 (at the moment
there aren't any other option).

The steps for loading Open PS2 Loader in a PS3 are:

    1. Rename OpenPS2LD.ELF to SMBOOT0.ELF
	2. Make a folder in root of USB device called SWAPMAGIC and copy 
	   SMBOOT0.ELF to it.
	3. Launch SwapMagic in PS3 and press UP+L1 then Open PS2 Loader should
	   start.
	   
There are 4 forms for launching elfs in SwapMagic.

SMBOOT0.ELF = UP + L1
SMBOOT1.ELF = UP + L2
SMBOOT2.ELF = UP + R1
SMBOOT3.ELF = UP + R2

Some notes for devs

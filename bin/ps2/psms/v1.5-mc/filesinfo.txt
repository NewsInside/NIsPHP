NOTE:
v1.5 release of psms does not contain a CD version of psms.
If you want to boot psms from CD please use the previously
released version (don't worry, not much has changed in this
version).  This file is included with CD information simply
because MC version still requires FILES.TXT and I don't have
time to rewrite it to be MC specific ;)

When PSMS boots, its looks for a file called "FILES.TXT". This
file contains a list of all the roms on the MC, and the actual
game names for each of the roms. In order for PSMS to work
correctly, FILES.TXT must be made correctly - dont expect PSMS
to work right if you mess something up. You have two choices
when it comes to making your FILES.TXT file: You can use a nice
GUI app coded by Justice, or you can create it manually. If you
want to use the GUI app, download from http://psms.gamebase.ca and 
follow the instructions included in the archive. If you want to
create your FILES.TXT manually, follow the instructions below.

----------------------------------------------------------------

   Filenames must be in 8.3 format - ########.### (ALEXKIDD.SMS
   or SONIC.GG are valid 8.3 filenames). You may not have more
   than 30 files per directory, so if you have more than 30 roms
   you must span them accross several directories (ie, ROMS1\
   ROMS2\ ROMS3\ - each of these dirs can hold up to 30 roms).

   Create the "FILES.TXT" file. This file accociates actual game
   names with filenames. You must use the full filenames realative
   to the BADATA-SYSTEM directory of the MC (as long as all your
   roms are in the Your System Configuration save as suggested,
   just use the filename and ignore the path)

   The text file is set out as follows:

   Alex the Kidd,ALEXKIDD.SMS
   Asterix,ASTERIX.SMS
   California Games,CALIFGAM.SMS

   ... and so on.

   There must be a comma in-between the game name and filename.
   Make sure you press enter after the last entry (there must be a
   newline character after the last entry).

   There is currently a "bug" in the file reading code that PSMS
   uses - it can only read 16 bytes from a file at a time. If your
   file is NOT a multiple of 16 bytes, the last few characters will
   not be read. To fix this, pad the end of the file with spaces
   until it is a multiple of 16 bytes.

   NOTE: This "bug" should no longer be a problem, but if you are
   having problems and are in doubt, padd to 16 bytes.

   NOTE: If you are a Linux user, make sure to create the FILES.TXT
   as a DOS format text file, as the current version seems to have
   issues if the file is not DOS format.

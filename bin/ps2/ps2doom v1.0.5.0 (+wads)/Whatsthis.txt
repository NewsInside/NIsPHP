This is version 1.0.5.0 of PS2Doom, a port of Doom for the PS2 started by Lukasz Bruun
(http://lukasz.dk) and currently maintained by me,
cosmito (http://ps2homebrewing.wordpress.com).
It also features audio support functions by Jason Yu (http://www.jasonyu.net)
and contributions for HDD support by Adilson Pierog.

Run PS2Doom.elf using uLaunchELF and make sure you have a doom1.wad, doom.wad, or doom2.wad
(note: case sensitive, that is, DOOM1.WAD, DOOM.WAD, DOOM2.WAD, etc will not work) copied
at the same directory as the ps2doom.elf. Memory cards and USB storage devices can be used
also.


Dualshock Joystick default mappings:
====================================

Left Analog Stick  : Move
Right Analog Stick : Strafe
Cross              : Shift / Run
Square             : o / Previous weapon
Circle             : p / Next weapon
Triangle           : Escape
L1                 : n
L2                 : y
R1                 : Fire
R2                 : Space / Open doors

Start              : Enter
Select             : Map

Dpad buttons		   : Move

Analog Right click: Brightness (gamma)


Please note: Enter key action (required to menu operations like starting new game) is a bit
clumsy for now. For bringing up the menu, use the Cross button but to select items, use the
Start button.

You can use any USB compatible keyboard with the PlayStation2 also.


Ps2doom configuration:
======================

Version 1.0.5.0 features a configuration file named 'ps2doom.config'. It can be manually edited
to redefine the game controls at a computer or at the PS2 using uLaunchELF text editor, for example.

Here to place the configuration file?

At startup it looks for the configuration file first at the same folder ps2doom is running and if it
doesn’t find it, then looks at memory card (mc0:ps2doom).

Normally you would put the file along with the ps2doom executable but it requires a different approach
when running off HDD. There’s a simple rule you can follow:

 - If you want to run it off USB device or memory card you just place it along the ELF. Additionally,
   if you want the option to run it also from HDD, then you must place the configuration file
   at memory card (mc0:ps2doom). Also in this case you must set the HDD paths. I recommend having only one
   configuration file, placed at the memory card.

The reason for this is that there's no way of knowing the launch path when running off HDD
so it cannot load the configuration file from the local folder simply because it doesn’t
know where the local folder is. So if running from HDD, it will look at the memory card location
after failing to it it from the local folder.

If you want to load the WADs from the HDD you also need to edit the hdd section of the config.
Example: Supposing you have the doom wads placed at a partition named '+MyPartition' inside the
'ps2doom' folder, (at '+MyPartition/ps2doom/ that is) the hdd section should be :

  hdd:
  {
     use_hdd           = false;						    // set to true if you want to load the WADs from the HDD
     path_to_partition = "hdd0:+MyPartition";		// Case sensitive !
     wads_folder       = "ps2doom";		         // Case sensitive !
  };

Remember that the paths are case sensitive, so "hdd0:+MyPartition" and "hdd0:+mypartition" are different paths!



Building from sources:
======================

For compiling, get free ps2sdk and gsKit revision 1470 and overwrite the files from
'sdk source changes\gsKit_revision1470'. Get also SDL for PS2, revision 1384 or less
overwrite it with 'sdk source changes\SDL\SDL_ps2video.c'. If you want to get USB
keyboard support, make sure you build SDL with the HAVE_INPUT_DEVICES=1 at the makefile:

\sdl\src\Makefile
# Enable USB keyboard and mouse (100 KB)
HAVE_INPUT_DEVICES=1

Build 'ps2sdk\ee\debug\' with the supplied changes.

History:
========

21/03/2010 - v1.0.5.0
  - Simple but funcional wad selector
  - Controller almost fully configurable using the configuration file (ps2doom.config)
  - HDD support (at last). Thanks Adilson for the boring work
  - Now uses freesd instead of rom0:LIBSD. Japanese users should be happy now. And PS3 compatible now?
  - For doom2 wads, sound is no longer half sampled. Sounds the same to me...

12/06/2009 - v1.0.4.1
  - Savegame handling for different WAD : Now savegames from doom1 and doom2 and other WADs can happy cohexist at the same memory card

Important: This means that your previous saves needs to be renamed at the PS2DOOM memory
card folder. Use uLaunchELF for that (copy the save files to a USB storage device for
example, rename those at your computer - see below, delete those same files at the memory 
card and copy the renamed saves from the USB device back to the PS2DOOM memory card 
folder). Refer to uLaunchELF documentation for this operations (I won't offer help at 
this subject).

Until now, the saves follows the scheme for all the WADs : doomsav0.dsg,  doomsav1.dsg,
and so on. For now on, the saves reflect the WAD name:

For doom2.wad savegames, you should use the the naming scheme : doom2sav0.dsg,  doom2sav1.dsg, etc. Similarly for doom1.wad saves, this will be doom1sav0.dsg,  doom1sav1.dsg.

For doom.wad, the filenames should be doomsav0.dsg,  etc. You get the picture (sorry to explain this to detail, but I wanted to keep this clear).

  - Should work with the doom2f.wad (I don't own it)
  - Previous/next weapon selection was buggy (some weapons weren't selectable) - fixed
  - Fixed a crash when a lump is not found (doom.wad at "menu slideshow") - original sources bug?
  - Save/load file handle fixed (no more trying to load/save from empty slots)

31/05/2009 - v1.0.4.0
  - Strafe support for right analog stick. Now map button is Select instead of right analog click, using dlanor suggestion as stated over http://psx-scene.com/forums/454723-post22.html.

01/05/2009 - v1.0.3.0
  - Now loads the .wad from current directory. No need to put it at a root of a USB device anymore. As consequence, loads perfectly from memory card.
  - The Quit option menu now boots back to the OSD PS2 Browser

20/04/2009 - v1.0.2.2
  - Enabled game save/load to memory card (mc0:). Use R1 e R2 buttons to write funny savenames
  - Nicer 'debug' font (thanks NoEffex and Allen http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11663)

12/03/2009 - v1.0.2.1
  - No more hicups on sound during screen melt/wipe effect

01/03/2009 - v1.0.2.0
  - Support for USB keyboard (yeah!)
  - Hardwired button mappings to previous/next weapon, gamma correction, run, map view. L1 button now results in 'n' key instead of a 'x' key.
  - If no WAD file found at USB device, warn user.

24/02/2009 - v1.0.1.0
  - Fixes sound from original Lukasz port.

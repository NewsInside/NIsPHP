--------------------- Changes Notes and others ---------------------
                          important notes!

   [*] USB MASS Support
                                -----------------
 That was my major goal for my release. This PS2InfoGB uses USBHDFSD.IRX rev. 1534
 and USBD.IRX rev. 1494 modules (source code from http://svn.ps2dev.org/)

 USB Mass Support also extended ability added by dlanor in rev. 2 (I mean about
 to exit from emu to user defined console manager). Now it's possible to run
 your ELF file from USB mass storage. You can edit your INFOGB.CNF placed
 on mc0:/PS2GB/. All you have to do is just change line:

    "boot_ELF = mc0:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF"
     to
    "boot_ELF = mass:/PATH/YOUR_FILE.ELF"

 and save changes.

 There is possibility that your USB device can be not recognized by PS2InfoGB!
 I don't guarantee correctly work!

   [*] Real Time Clock
 
 In revision 5c I've made mistake. Now it's fixed, but SOME SAVE GAMES, WHICH USE REAL 
 TIME CLOCK (ROM type ROM+MBC3+TIMER+RAM+BATT and ROM+MBC3+TIMER+BATT) MIGHT BE
 NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THIS REVISION (IT'S ACTUALLY RANDOM). THE ONLY WAY TO FULLY FIX
 IT YOU HAVE TO REMOVE OLD SAVE AND START GAME AGAIN.

 Well, probably you will be able to continue game but without real time clock.
 Sometimes games offer to set real time clock (e.g. Pokemon Crystal), but you will
 set it evry time you load battery backed save.

 But as I said, it's random, so it doesn't always happen.

   [*] New In-browser menu with options

 You can enter this menu only from browser by press start button. You can change here:
   - Current Save Device - This is device where saves (*.srm and *.sav) will be stored. 
     You can change it from default MC0 device to MC1 or MASS. "PS2GB" folder will be
     created automatically on this device (if not exists yet). If device will be not
     available on the next reboot than current save divice will be set to default
     MC0 debvice, PS2InfoGB will let you know about that fact.

     Notice that saves are not copied from one device to another, so when you change
     save device, than saves from previouse device will be not available (if you don't
     copy them yourself).

     Also remember that config file is always save to MC0 so if you run program without
     memorycard in MC0 than default config will be loaded and Current Save Device will be 
     set to default (MC0) device.

   - Preselected ROM - in In-browser menu you can only turn off preselected ROM. The option
     will be set to "Turn off" if any ROM is currently preselected. When you choose this
     option than it will switch to "Not defined", which means that preselected ROM is
     canceled.
     
     More details below in paragraph "Preselecting ROM".

   - Screen Adjustment - by selecting this option you can adjust screen X, Y offsets.
     You can move screen by pressing DPAD (arrows) buttons. When you done just press
     X button.
   
   - Buttons configuration - see paragraph "Possibility to change buttons configuration"
   
   - Turbo buttons - On/Off turbo buttons

   - Show FPS - On/off current FPS rate info

   - Boot ELF - saves current config and run ELF follow ELF Path.

   [*] Preselecting ROM

 This option dlanor has added in Rev.3. Since this revision preselecting ROM is easier 
 to use. You don't have to edit your config every time you would like to preselect a new 
 ROM. All you have to do is choose the option called "Preselect this ROM" (In-game menu).

 When you choose it the name of this option should change to "This ROM is preselected". 
 It means, since now every time you reboot PS2InfoGB, message box will appear and if you 
 agree then preselected ROM will be loaded, if not than you will return to browser.

 You can turn off this option anytime you want. Just open In-browser menu (push start in 
 browser) and turn it off.

 I DON'T WARRANT BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVOUSE REVISIONS. I RECOMMEND TO REMOVE OR MAKE 
 A COPY OF ALL .srm AND .sav FILE BEFORE YOU RUN A NEW REVISION. SOMETIMES THERE IS NEED TO CHANGE 
 SAVE FILE STRUCTURE SO IT MAY BE NOT COMPATIBILE WITH PREVIOUSE ONE! DON'T FORGET THIS FUNCTION IS 
 STILL IN BETA TESTING

   [*] Possibility to change button configuration
 
 Now you can freely change your button configuration. Enter In-browser menu and find option
 called "Button configure". You will be asked for pressing buttons. If option "Turbo Buttons" 
 is "On" you will be asked for 4 more buttons.

 Every single gameboy or turbo button can be assign only to one PS2 PAD button, cause you 
 can't assign e.g. A and B button to X at the same time, so chosen button will be blocked 
 to avoid this situation.

 DPAD (ARROWS) buttons are not changeable and you can't assign any gameboy or turbo button 
 to DPAD buttons.

 Configuration is saved to file BUTTONS.DAT (located in mc0:/PS2GB/) This file is not 
 readable for human being so don't try to open it)

   [*] Save and Load Game State

 "Save State to [device]" and "Load State of [device]" options are finally implemented.
 But! It has been tested with three ROMs so I'm not really sure how it will work with
 other ROMs.
 
 This method take about 50kB per game state on memory card (so it's pretty much, sorry
 for that, but this emu is not adapted for such things, but maybe I will add zip compression
 in future revision)

 The location of save state and battery backed save depends on which current device is set.
 Basically it's [device]:/PS2GB/. You can change "Current Save Device" in In-browser menu
 to MC0, MC1 and MASS.
 
 I DON'T WARRANT BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVOUSE REVISIONS. I RECOMMEND TO REMOVE 
 ALL .srm AND .sav FILE WHEN YOU RUN A NEW REVISION. SOMETIMES THERE IS NEED TO CHANGE 
 SAVE FILE STRUCTURE SO IT MAY BE NOT COMPATIBILE WITH PREVIOUSE ONE!

   [*] Sorting List

 Since this release list with ROM entries and directories will be sorted. There is
 implemented algorithm QuickSort. First are listing folders following by this pattern 
 0-9A-Za-z, then files in the same way.

   [*] Other notes

- Please be careful with names of your ROM files and folders. They will be not longer
 than 31 characters (or 64 if save device is set to MASS). If you use longer file
 name, it may cause some problemslike missing save game and other failures, so since
 this release emulator will not run kind of files anymore - it will let you know by 
 show you the warning message box

- In one folder you can put up to 256 files and up to 128 folders. Don't magnify
 with folder depth either!
 
- "Important reminder for saved games:
 
 If you are playing a game that saves to the GB 'battery RAM', make
 sure that you never turn off the PS2 while the game screen is showing.

 You need to make sure that the 'battery RAM' of the emulator is also
 transferred to a separate *.sav file in the save folder 'mc0:/PS2GB/'
 so that the correct saves can be restored the next time you play the
 same game. This is NOT done at the time when you save game as part of
 the gameplay. That only saves to the internal RAM of the emulator.

 The only time when such saves are transferred to mc0 is when you break
 off playing by using the submenu command "Back to the main menu". This
 takes you back to the ROM browser where you originally started the game.
 When you see that browser appear on screen, your saves are saved to the
 memory card, so you can then turn off the PS2 without 'losing place' in
 the GB game"

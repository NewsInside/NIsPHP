<b><big><a name="Installing">1. Installing & Configuring myPS2</a></b></big>

To install myPS2 to your memory card simply transfer the following directories
and files using your favourite file manager or FTP program (Directory- and
filenames are case sensitive).

	/boot/
	/fonts/
	/language/
	/shoutcast/
	/skins/
	/logs/
	MYPS2.ELF
	CONFIG.DAT
	samba.xml

After you have transfered the files just launch the MYPS2.ELF executable
from your bootlauncher application.

If you want to install the program to your HDD you must add two entries
to the CONFIG.DAT file:

hdd_boot_part	= hdd0:PARTITION
hdd_boot_path	= /PROGRAMS/MYPS2/

hdd_boot_part is the name of the partition you have myPS2 installed on.
hdd_boot_path is the path of the directory you have myPS2 installed in.

You can also run the program from CD. To do this burn the files on CD along
with the SYSTEM.CNF file. You should also add a dummy file to the compilation.
It doesn't matter what this file is, just make sure it's at least 30 MB.

<b><a name="USB_Support">USB Support</a></b>

If you want to use your USB stick with myPS2 you need to supply an
USBD.IRX module. You can find this module on many PS2 game discs so
you can just copy it from one of your games.

Alternatively you can use the usbd module from Naplink which
can be downloaded at <a href="http://naplink.napalm-x.com/">http://naplink.napalm-x.com/</a>

myPS2 will look for the USBD.IRX module in the installation directory first.
If it can't find the file in the installation directory it will then look for
the module on the memory card in the following places:

	- mc0:/USBD.IRX
	- mc0:/SYS-CONF/USBD.IRX
	- mc0:/BOOT/USBD.IRX
	- mc0:/BOOT/SMS/USBD.IRX
	- mc0:/BOOT/PS2MP3/USBD.IRX
	- mc0:/SMS/USBD.IRX
	- mc0:/PS2MP3/USBD.IRX


<b><a name="HDD_Partition">HDD Partition</a></b>

If myPS2 detects a HDD on startup but cannot find a myPS2 partition, it will
ask you if you want to create one and guide you through the process. You don't
have to create a HDD partition but doing so will allow to use advanced features
such as Thumbnail Caching.

<b><a name="Samba">Accessing Samba (Windows) Network Shares</a></b>

You can access shared network folders from myPS2. To share a folder on a
network under Windows XP, right click it and select "Sharing and Security".
To access the share from myPS2 you must then add an entry to the samba.xml
file.

An entry in the file would look like this :

&lt;<font color="blue">share</font>&gt;
	&lt;<font color="blue">name></font>My C-Drive (SMB)&lt;<font color="blue">/name</font>&gt;
	&lt;<font color="blue">path></font>smb://username:password@computer/C/&lt;<font color="blue">/share</font>&gt;
&lt;<font color="blue">/share</font>&gt;

<i>name</i> is the name that will show up in the menu.
<i>path</i> is the path to the network share.

The path can include a username and a password, as in the example above.
Whether this is neccessary or not depends on your Windows/Samba configuration.

<i>computer</i> is the network name of the computer. You can also enter the IP
address of the computer instead of its name.

If you want to use this feature you must first configure the network in the
<a href="Readme.html#Network_Settings">Network Settings</a> menu.

<a href="images/smb_1.jpg"><img src="images/smb_1_sm.jpg" border="0"></a>  <a href="images/smb_2.jpg"><img src="images/smb_2_sm.jpg" border="0"></a>

This is a new feature and I have only tested it with my Windows XP box. It <i>should</i>
work with all other versions of Windows or Samba, but if you can not get it to work,
here are some things to try out :

 - If you are running Windows XP it can help to turn off the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" setting under
   "Local Area Network Properties" -> "Advanced" -> "WINS"

 - Enter the IP address of your computer instead of its NetBIOS name in the samba.xml file.

 - Create an <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/lmhost.htm">lmhosts file</a> with appropriate settings for your network and upload it
   to mc0:lmhosts

 - Make sure you can access your shares from other computers in the network.


<b><big><a name="My_Pictures">My Pictures</a></b></big>

This lets you browse picture collections on CD/DVD/MC/HDD/USB or Samba shares.

The "Cache Images" Option generates thumbnails for all images in the current
directory and stores them on the HDD. This reduces loading times alot.

Clicking on a thumbnail will open the detail view of the image. In detail
view you can zoom in and out with the CIRCLE and SQUARE buttons. To return
to the thumbnail view press the TRIANGLE button.

<b><big><a name="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></b></big>

	<i><b>Do I need a harddisk to run myPS2?</b></i>

	No, myPS2 will also work without a harddisk but some features can only be used if
	a HDD is present.

	<i><b>Can I run myPS2 on unmodified consoles?</b></i>

	There are ways to run homebrew programs on unmodified consoles such as the independence
	exploit or swap tricks. If you want to know how any of these work check out the forums
	at <a href="http://www.ps2hd.com/">http://www.ps2hd.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.ps2-scene.org/">http://www.ps2-scene.org/</a>.

	<i><b>My USB stick does not work!</i></b>

	You have to supply an USBD.IRX module if you want to use your USB stick with myPS2, read
	<a href="Readme.html#USB_Support">here</a>. Also there are some USB sticks that won't work with myPS2.

	<i><b>When I try to rename a directory on my memory card nothing happens?</b></i>

	Renaming directories on Memory Cards and USB sticks has not been implemented yet.

	<i><b>Can I use myPS2 to watch DivX movies?</b></i>

	No, myPS2 currently does not have any video playback functionality. You should check out
	EEUG's <a href="http://home.casema.nl/eugene_plotnikov/" target="_blank">Simple Media System</a> (SMS) for that!

	<i><b>I get a blackscreen but the bootscreen said everything was OK?</i></b>

	You have probably installed a bad skin then. After myPS2 has loaded all of its drivers it
	resets the graphics synthesizer and tries to load the skin. If it encounters a problem while
	loading the skin the program will halt. You can either edit the CONFIG.DAT manually and change
	the "skin_name" setting back to "default" or boot in safe mode (read below) and then change
	the skin in the <a href="Readme.html#Skin_Settings">Skin Settings</a> menu.

	<i><b>I changed something in the config file and now the program won't boot anymore.</b></i>

	You can either try to run another program and simply delete the myPS2 CONFIG.DAT file or
	you can boot in safe mode.

	To boot in safe mode press R1, R2, L1 and L2 simultaneously while myPS2 is booting. myPS2 will
	then use the default system settings rather than reading the settings from the CONFIG.DAT.

	<i><b>Feature XY doesn't work / The program crashes when I try to...</b></i>

	If you find any unknown bugs please send me an <a href="mailto:torben.koenke@web.de">email</a> and let me know. Otherwise I can't fix them.
	You can also post at one of the forums mentioned in the <a href="Readme.html#Links">Links Section</a> to get help.

	<i><b>How do I install custom skins?</b></i>

	Extract the custom skin to the /skins/ directory. It should then show up in the Settings menu
	under "Skins".

	<i><b>How do I install language packs?</b></i>

	Copy the language xml file into the /language/ directory. It should then show up in the Settings
	menu under "Language". If your language pack does not use the default Latin-1 character encoding
	you will also have to change the "Charset" setting in the Language Menu.

	<i><b>I can not access my Samba network shares</b></i>

	Make sure your Windows Network/Samba configuration is correct, check if you can access your shared
	folders from other computers in the network so you can rule out configuration and access problems.
	If you are running Windows XP it can help to turn off the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" setting under
	Network Configuration.

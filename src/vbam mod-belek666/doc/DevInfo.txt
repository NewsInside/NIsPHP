Known preprocessor switches:
- SDL: Defined for the SDL version
- GBA_LOGGING: Enables logging for the GBA core
- FINAL_VERSION: Defined for release versions, disables additional GBA logging and completely disables GB logging. Increases the amount of CPU cycles being emulated in one go.
- BKPT_SUPPORT
- MMX: Enable MMX instruction set
- NO_ASM: Use C++ version of hq3x/4x filters
- RGB555: Use 16bit colors with 5bit green instead of 6bit green in hq3x/4x filters (C++ version)
- NO_OGL: Exclude OpenGL code
- NO_D3D: Exclude Direct3D code
- NO_OAL: Exclude OpenAL code
- NO_XAUDIO2: Exclude XAudio2 code (the XAudio2 interface is DirectSound's successor)

You can find pre-built versions of zlib & libpng at:
http://vba-m.ngemu.com/vbam/vbasources/libs/
Just extract them somewhere and point Visual C++ 2008 to the include & lib folders.
They are built with the static C runtime (this is what the releases use).

# Visual C++ 2008 project files #
#################################

Using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, you can build the Windows/MFC version.
Refer to the instructions below for further assistance:

===Win32/MFC===
This is the full-featured Windows build using the MFC GUI.
The project files are located in trunk/project/vc2008_mfc (VBA2008.sln).
Before you can compile it, you have to take care of some prerequisites:
Download the zlib & libpng sources from the internet and extract them both to the same folder.
Rename them so you have a folder called libpng and another one called zlib in the same loaction.
Open libpng/projects/visualc71/libpng.sln. Let the assistant convert them if necessary.
Build the "DLL Release" & "DLL Debug" configurations.
Set up your operating system's PATH variable to point to the created zlib & libpng DLLs.
Set up your compiler's LIB & INCLUDE paths to point to the created lib files and the source files.
You also have to install Microsoft's DirectX SDK for DirectInput & XAudio2.
If you want to enable OpenAL sound output, install the OpenAL SDK. If you do not want it, #define NO_OAL.
Some pixel filters come with assembler code, which compatible to the NASM syntax.
Extract NASM somewhere and add it to your compiler's executable file paths.
All .asm files will be handled with the "nasm.rules" build rules file which comes with this project file.

PlayStation 2 DOSBox 0.74 Port by KarasQ

to compile DOSBox 0.74 you have to have SDL library IN your $PS2DEV folder
In SDL library should be "include" folder with all SDL headers and "lib"
folder with already compiled "libsdl.a" and "libsdlmain.a" libraries.

Now you have to run makefile by typeing "make" command.
Those steps will be done automatically

1. Download DOSBox 0.74 source code
2. Extract source code to "dosbox-0.74"
3. Apply patch "patch/ps2-dosbox-0.74.patch"
4. Start compilation (make -f dosbox-0.74/Makefile.ps2)

If linker throw "cannot find -ln" error then follow this step:

Go to $PS2DEV/ee/ee/lib (default /usr/local/ps2dev/ee/ee/lib) and
rename file libc.a to libn.a (explanation you can find here:
http://psx-scene.com/forums/f176/snes9x-ps2-58208/index44.html#post482179).

If your evnrionment is set up properly everything should compile
successfully. I compiled PS2 Toolchain uder Windows MinGW port 
with MSYS.

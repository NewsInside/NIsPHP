To compile Bochs-2.4.6 you have to have SDL library IN your $PS2DEV folder ($PS2DEV/SDL)
In SDL library folder should be "include" folder with all SDL headers and "lib"
folder with already compiled "libsdl.a" and "libsdlmain.a" libraries.

If you already have SDL in other folder than $PS2DEV/SDL you should made path changes
in ./bochs-2.4.6/Makefile.ps2 (when source is already patched of course).

Now you have to run makefile by typeing make command.
Those steps will be done automatically

1. Download Bochs-2.4.6 source code
2. Extract source code to "bochs-2.4.6"
3. Apply patch patch/ps2-bochs-2.4.6.patch (patch -p0 -i patch/ps2-bochs-2.4.6.patch)
4. Copy IRX modules from ./irx to ./bochs-2.4.6/ps2/irx
5. Copy configuration file from ./config.h/ps2-config.h to ./bochs-2.4.6 as "config.h"
6. Start compilation (in ./bochs-2.4.6 type "make -f Makefile.ps2 config all")

If your evnrionment is set up properly everything should compile
successfully. I compiled PS2 toolchain uder Windows XP and 
MinGW port with MSYS.

Following problems might occure, though:

1. If linker throws at the end of compilation "cannot find -ln" error 
then follow this step:

Go to $PS2DEV/ee/ee/lib (default /usr/local/ps2dev/ee/ee/lib) and
rename file libc.a to libn.a (explanation of this you can find here:
http://psx-scene.com/forums/f176/snes9x-ps2-58208/index44.html#post482179).

2. If you running through ps2client make sure that in ./bochs-2.4.6/ps2/PS2Init.cpp
in PS2_Init() function IopReset is switched off or you will lose controle to your PS2
(This is defaultly switched off, so remeber to switch on when you want to run without
ps2client help)

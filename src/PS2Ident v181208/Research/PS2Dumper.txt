ROM sizes:
Get from the DECR field (20:16) of the timing registers of the SSBUSC:
	DVD ROM (DEV1)
	Boot ROM (DEV2)

	On the DTL-T10000, DEV1 exists, but does not contain a DVD Player.
	Instead, it contains information on the installed hardware, at memory address 0x1FBF0000.

	DEV1 was possibly originally located at 0x1FA00000 (after DEV2), as that is the power-on address for DEV1.
	However, it might have been moved to 0x1E000000 (before DEV2), after its size was increased.
